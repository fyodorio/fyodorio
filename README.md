### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fyodor

I'm a software people.

I build web applications, APIs, CLIs, SDKs, and all the glue stuff that makes them work better. I respect minimalist design, both for architecture and for UI/UX. I always aspire to craft simple, robust, and scalable solutions that don't make users think a lot on tooling doing their actual job.

When I'm not working, running, or hanging out with my family and pets, I blog about technology at my [personal website](https://fyodor.io/) and at [dev.to](https://dev.to/fyodorio). Yeah, I mostly do the former list though...

Most of my current new beginnings and personal projects are here, some of the older ones are stored in a [dedicated closet](https://github.com/fyodorio-closet). 

I like meeting new like-minded people, so feel free to [reach out and get in touch](https://fyodor.io/links/).
