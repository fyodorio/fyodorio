### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fyodor

I'm a software people.

I build software products and tools, specifically web applications, APIs, CLIs, SDKs, and all the glue stuff that makes them work better. I respect minimalist design, both for architecture and for UI/UX. I always aspire to craft simple, robust, and scalable solutions that don't make users think a lot on tooling doing their actual job.

When I'm not working, running, or chilling out with my family and pets, I curate [the Metaframeworks Weekly newsletter](https://metaframe.works), blog about technology at my [personal website](https://fyodor.io/), and hang out at [dev.to](https://dev.to/fyodorio).

Most of my current new beginnings and personal projects are here, some of the older ones are stored in a [dedicated closet](https://github.com/fyodorio-closet). 

I like meeting new like-minded people, so feel free to [reach out and get in touch](https://fyodor.io/links/).
