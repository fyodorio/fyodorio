### Hi üëã I'm Fyodor

I'm a software engineer (9 to 5) and an indie hacker (by night).

I like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript and use it mostly with Angular tools. I build web applications and hybrid mobile apps. I like minimalist UI/UX designs with smooth animations. I convert them into simple, robust, and scalable solutions that don't make users think a lot and just do their job. Probably it's because I live in the severe forests of Siberia ‚ùÑÔ∏è

When I'm not working, running, or hanging out with my family, I blog about technology at my [personal website](https://fyodor.io/) and at [dev.to](https://dev.to/fyodorio). Sometimes I also draw and animate stuff with CSS at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/fyodorio).

I like meeting new like-minded people, so feel free to reach out [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fyodorio) or get in touch [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fyodorio/).
