### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fyodor

I'm a software engineer.

I like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I build web applications, CLIs, and mobile apps. I like minimalist UI/UX designs with smooth animations. I craft simple, robust, and scalable solutions that don't make users think a lot and just do their job.

When I'm not working, running, or hanging out with my family and pets, I blog about technology at my [personal website](https://fyodor.io/) and at [dev.to](https://dev.to/fyodorio). Yeah, I mostly do the former list though...

Most of my current new beginnings and personal projects are here, some of the older ones are stored in a [dedicated closet](https://github.com/fyodorio-closet). The one project that I like especially and try to develop on is the customizable [learnining platform](https://github.com/latt-dev) for small developer teams.

I like meeting new like-minded people, so feel free to reach out and get in touch.
